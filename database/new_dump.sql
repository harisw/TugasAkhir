I opened the envelope very á\ncarefully and found that my results were much better than I á\nhad expected and thus I could enter the Chinese university.  My á\ndiligence had paid and I was very happy.'),

	(6390, 'anger', 'Whenever my father smokes the smell makes me feel very á\nuncomfortable.  He never listens to my complaints and I curse him á\nfuriously in my mind.  I cannot solve this problem by violence á\nbecause of traditional moral values. '),
	(6391, 'sadness', 'My got my mathematics test\'s marks and could not believe that it á\nwas true.  In the past I would have at least 80% marks.  Was I á\ngetting weaker at studies ?  This made me feel that I should not á\nexpect too much from going to the university.'),
	(6392, 'disgust', 'My friend and I worked for the community centre by holding a booth. á\n One day my friend went off to another booth to play.  This á\nmeant that I was very busy and could not maintain order.  His á\nbehaviour disgusted me.'),
	(6393, 'shame', 'When I was in a bus on my way to the examination centre, a man    á\nsitting opposite me kept looking at me continously.  I did not know  á\nwhat was wrong.  When I reached the  centre I started strolling around  á\nas I still had a little time.  Suddenly a man came and whispered "You  á\nhave forgotten to zip up your trousers."  I was at a loss to say anything  á\nand I felt very embarrassed.  When I thought of the bus incident I felt  á\neven more ashamed.'),

However my friend á\nhad never introduced me to her and when she got off the bus I á\nsmiled at her but she did not respond pretending not to have seen á\nme.  Her arrogant behaviour made me sick and angry.'),
	(6397, 'sadness', 'My examination results were not satisfactory even though I had á\ntried my best.  Then I started wondering about my abilities for á\nthe major subject.  However I did not know how to choose my major á\nsubject if I were to change it.'),
	(6398, 'disgust', 'When my roommate and I had dinner together we decided as to who á\nwould clean the bowls.  One day when I came back from school I á\nfound that she had not cleaned up.  Since I had to cook dinner I á\ncleaned them myself and felt unhappy and disgusted.'),
	(6399, 'shame', 'When I asked my classmate to teach me to do my homework, he asked á\nme to study by myself first but I did not do it.  When he asked me á\n if I had studied, I felt very ashamed.'),

	(6402, 'anger', 'My friend half-teasingly called me a bad nickname.  I felt á\ninsulted and kicked his hip in anger.  I was stable later and did á\nnot feel angry at him.  In fact I was afraid that the other á\nfriends who were with us would think that I was an intolerant á\nperson.  However I could not apologize, so I pretended that á\nnothing had happened and smiled when I left.  My friend did not á\nsay anything but just watched me leave.'),
	(6403, 'sadness', 'Last night I did not do very well in one of the subjects.  Before á\nthe result was announced I feared that I would fail.  Finally I á\ngot a D and as the results of the other subjects were not all      á\ngood I felt a little sad.'),

	(6419, 'fear', 'It was a week before the higher level results were announced.  I á\nhad tried and failed many times and this was the last time that á\nI was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld á\nhave to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period á\n- I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice á\nexperience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable á\nfear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright á\nprospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my á\nbrother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue á\nI could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased.'),
	(6420, 'anger', 'The surname of my brother was different from ours.  He often á\ngrinned at home and provoked others for the pleasure of it.  This á\nmade me angry.'),
	(6421, 'sadness', 'When I was in primary 6, my father died.  I was very young then á\nand did not know what had happened.  The weeping of my relatives á\nand my tears made me sad.'),
	(6422, 'disgust', 'At hostel, my roommate was a very selfish person and would avoid á\ndoing anyhting that did not concern him.  A few of us prepared lunch á\ntogether and had decided to share the work.  My roomate had á\npromised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime á\nafter dinner.  I tried to wait and thought that he would realize á\nhis fault.  I did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a á\nuniversity student and ought to have self-respect.  He á\ndisappointed me and so every time I saw him I tried to avoid him á\nand did not want to keep any contact with him.'),

	(6424, 'joy', 'In August,1983, the long awaited "big envelope" (a document for á\nC.U.H.K admission) arrived.  It was in the afternoon and I had á\nnot been doing anything.  When the postman, with his big bag, á\nknocked on the door I knew what it was about.  I hurriedly á\nopened the envelope and my mood at that time is hard to describe. á\n It lasted several hours and only calmed down later.'),

I thought that I had only a 50% chance of á\npassing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to á\nrepeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results á\nwere bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a á\nminor in this subject I would be very unwilling.'),
	(6426, 'anger', 'In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not á\nlike.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation á\nwas like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt á\nthat I had got 95 marks in a test he told me " A failure, You lost á\n5 marks."   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower á\nthan his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not á\nshow my discontentment and carried on doing my work.'),
	(6427, 'sadness', 'This issue worried me rather than saddening me.  In mid September á\nI went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in á\nthe evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not á\nfind anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about á\nsleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  á\nI finally found a place to sleep at 8 o\'clock.'),
	(6428, 'disgust', 'My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had á\nmelody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played á\nthe recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell á\nhim that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right á\nto disturb the freedom of others.  So I would find a pretext to á\nleave the room and go somewhere else.'),
	(6429, 'shame', 'Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students.  As I was á\nworking then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had á\njoined us the first night).  Next morning, 6 o\'clock, a female á\nclassmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up.  I was not á\nfully conscious and I said something which I should not have.  I á\nrealized the trouble I had made and wanted to hide.  Later I á\nsaid sorry to her and the matter came to an end.'),

However she did not listen to me á\nand this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  á\nWhen I entered university the girl\'s parents suggested that I be á\nemployed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  á\nthere was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they á\nmade a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five á\ndays a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another á\nchild to teach.'),
