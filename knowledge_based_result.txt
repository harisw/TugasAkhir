to be the opening lecture.  I had been confident all morning, about a
twenty minutes before the lecture, my confidence started failing a

disgust  This is an incident that many of us witness in our everyday life a
in a city like Bombay.  One day I was travelling by bus, three a
men dragged two fellows out of the bus.  Once outside they were a
beaten into pulp.  These two fellows, who got beaten, were pick-pockets a
and they were being beaten by all and sundry.  I thought to a
myself -"what is life?".  It is one hell of a place where a
everyone is after someone else.  One waits to cut the throat of a
the other one just for a living, (money).  When I think about a
such things - the purpose of life, etc, I feel very disgusted and a
dejected. || None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None thing None None None None None None None None None None None disgust None None None None

mimic.  This particular day we were waiting for a professor a
to take her class.  This  professor had a peculiar accent and a a
very horrible way of lecturing and to top it all we had this a
class at the fag end of the day.  So this particular day I got a
into my element and started imitating the professor, and the a
professor entered the class right in the middle of it .  I was a
unaware of her presence, some of my friends tried to warn me but a
it was of no avail as I was too engrossed in mimicing.  Then I a
suddenly noticed the silence and turned around to see her a
entering the class.  I do not know till today if she actually saw a
what I had been doing or she had completely ignored it.  Through  a
out that lecture I died of shame.  All the more shameful was the a
fact that she gave me a character certificate. || None None None None None None None None None None None None None benevolence None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None horror None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None shame None None None None shame None None None None None None None None None None None None

friends did not care for me.  Although I could still be with them a
I felt unimportant.  I deeply thought about the reason behind a
this so as to see who was responsible for this.  Finally I made a
up my mind and decided not to expect too much from them.  I was a

friend of mine, who is also a classmate, told me that my a

been accepted.  I was not very sure as I did not know that the a
list had been declared.  I ran to the board and saw that I was a
really included in the list.  I was so excited that I smiled all a
day long.  When I met my classmates and friends I told them the a

outside.  I thought that he would reveal what he felt and would a

did not want any misunderstandings.  Therefore I refused to meet a
him and told him that I would see him the coming day.  I was very a

 One day my friend went off to another booth to play.  This a

sitting opposite me kept looking at me continously.  I did not know  a
what was wrong.  When I reached the  centre I started strolling around  a
as I still had a little time.  Suddenly a man came and whispered "You  a
have forgotten to zip up your trousers."  I was at a loss to say anything  a

I was taking the exam.  I knew that if i failed again I woulld a
have to enter the society.  I imagined things during this period a
- I dreamt that I had entered university and it was a nice a
experience.  When I thought about the future, an unexplainable a
fear rose in me.  I feared being a worker and not having a bright a
prospect, I also feared the criticism of my relatives as my a
brother had gone to university.  Whenevr I thought of this issue a
I could not eat or concentrate, and my heart beat increased. || None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None thing None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None negative-fear None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None affection None None None

doing anyhting that did not concern him.  A few of us prepared lunch a
together and had decided to share the work.  My roomate had a
promised to do the same but I had to wash the bowls everytime a
after dinner.  I tried to wait and thought that he would realize a
his fault.  I did not want to tell him to do the work as he is a a
university student and ought to have self-respect.  He a
disappointed me and so every time I saw him I tried to avoid him a
and did not want to keep any contact with him. ||

fear  On Christmas eve,1984, I had just finished the exams and was a
afraid as the results of one of my major subjects had been very a
unsatisfactory.  I thought that I had only a 50% chance of a
passing.  Even if I failed this subject I would not need to a
repeat.  However I liked this subject very much and my results a
were bad because of my lazyness.  If I was forced to change to a a

anger  In September 1984, I was forced to live with someone I did not a
like.  The first week we were at loggerheads and our conversation a
was like a debate.  The atmosphere was very bad.  When he learnt a
that I had got 95 marks in a test he told me " A failure, You lost a
5 marks."   I was very angry, not because my marks were lower a
than his, but because I could not tolerate his pride.  I did not a
show my discontentment and carried on doing my work. || None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None lost-sorrow None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None anger None None None None None None downheartedness None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None None

I went to Guanggho alone.  I was looking for an accomodation in a
the evening and after having walked 2 or 3 miles I still could not a
find anything.  What could I do?  I was not worried about a
sleeping on the streets but because of some procedural problems.  a
I finally found a place to sleep at 8 o'clock. || 
disgust  My roommate liked to listen to some meaningless songs which had a
melody but had no content.  We lived together so when he played a
the recorder I was forced to listen to them.  I could not tell a
him that I did not like to listen to the songs, as I had no right a
to disturb the freedom of others.  So I would find a pretext to a
leave the room and go somewhere else. || 
shame  Last Summer I went camping with some C.U students.  As I was a
working then, I had to leave the second night (some of them had a
joined us the first night).  Next morning, 6 o'clock, a female a
classmate knocked on our door and tried to wake us up.  I was not a
fully conscious and I said something which I should not have.  I a
realized the trouble I had made and wanted to hide.  Later I a

grand-daughter.  The grand-daughter asked me some questions in a
mathematics so I taught her.  However she did not listen to me a
and this made me feel unhappy.  The second year it was the same.  a
When I entered university the girl's parents suggested that I be a
employed as their daghters tutor.  They told me that at university  a
there was no homework and I would have a lot of time so they a
made a time-table  for me which required me to be the tutor five a
days a week.  They did not respect me and anyway I had another a
